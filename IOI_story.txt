When Liu Zemin was four years old, he asked his grandmother why the village rooster crowed exactly thirty-seven times before dawn. Nobody had ever tried to count before, but the boy’s certainty was unshakable. On the mud-walled balcony of their farmhouse outside Lujiang, Anhui Province, he watched the sun bleed over rice paddies and tallied the calls on smooth pebbles lined up like abacus beads. Each sunrise became an experiment, each pebble a proof. By first grade he was swapping pebbles for chalk, covering the schoolyard’s worn slate boards with rows of digits that formed little rivers—additions cascading into multiplications, multiplications spilling into factorials. His teacher, Ms. Zhang, kept those boards untouched until the rain washed them clean, convinced no textbook exercise could match the elegance of the child’s spontaneous arithmetic.

News of “the counting boy” traveled through the county on WeChat voice notes and motorcycle gossip. A local journalist arrived one humid afternoon and asked Zemin to demonstrate his gift. The boy faced the camera shyly, then rattled off prime numbers under one thousand while hopping on one foot, pausing only when his worn sandal snapped. The clip went semi-viral, and a provincial coach for primary-school math leagues snatched the footage from social media. He sent the family a single-line invitation: Bring the child to Hefei for the spring talent camp; tuition waived. Zemin’s father, who welded steel frames in a city two hours away, borrowed bus fare and delivered his son to a dormitory that still smelled of new paint. The boy’s only luggage was a cloth bag of cracked pebbles—good-luck talismans.

At camp Zemin first tasted structured competition. Timed quizzes thundered like summer rain: ten algebra riddles in five minutes, twenty geometry proofs back-to-back. Most pupils panicked. Zemin closed his eyes, visualizing Ms. Zhang’s blackboards as endless scrolls unrolling behind his eyelids, each formula glowing like wet rice stalks. He finished early, turned his paper over, and sketched a cartwheel of numbers for fun. Coaches circled the strange diagram, muttering, but overnight they framed it as a “creative approach to pentagonal number theory” in a camp newsletter. The boy’s myth grew legs.

Back home the farmhouse roof leaked, and electricity flickered in monsoon season. When Zemin turned eleven, his father arrived with a second-hand Lenovo laptop wrapped in plastic grocery bags. The screen’s hinge squeaked, but when Zemin discovered the pre-installed IDE and typed printf("Hello, world!\n"); the squeak vaporized into symphonies. Loops felt like counting rooster calls; conditionals felt like choosing pebbles. Within months he was scouring Baidu Baike for exposition on Dijkstra, Merge Sort, Gray Codes. He solved Project Euler problems offline—no internet access past 9 p.m.—scribbling C++ on lined paper and typing it verbatim the next morning while the rooster crowed its immutable thirty-seven.

Middle-school life in Lujiang rewarded rote memorization, not algorithmic flights. Zemin answered workbooks dutifully, then escaped into programming novella: contests on OIer forums, PDF bundles of past National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) problems sneaked via USB from a city cousin. His mother worried about nearsightedness; his father worried about tuition; Zemin worried only about time complexity. When he finally took the municipal informatics qualifier at thirteen, he topped the scoreboard so decisively that the proctor rechecked the grading script, sure a glitch inflated his points. “No glitch,” Zemin said. “I just memoized the recursive state space.”

By senior middle school he traveled monthly to Hefei for elite weekend trainings. In a fluorescent classroom littered with instant-noodle cups, he met Chen Xiaowen, who could implement a binary indexed tree blindfolded, and Li Rui, who wrote code so terse it read like haiku. The trio traded bugs like baseball cards, competing for who could crush them fastest. They shared whispered dreams of the International Olympiad in Informatics, the IOI, legendary arena where China’s red jackets glinted under camera flash. Yet qualifying meant first conquering the NOI, a crucible with a rejection rate fiercer than the summer sun that baked their dormitory windows shut.

Zemin’s first NOI attempt at fifteen garnered silver, not gold. He lost crucial points on a dynamic-programming task, misplacing a mod operator and letting integers overflow. In the cafeteria afterward, chopsticks hovering, he tasted the metallic tinge of disappointment for the first time. Coaches offered perfunctory comfort, but Zemin dissected the failure alone, writing a post-mortem longer than the original solution. He concluded his arrogance in skipping stress-testing had cost him. He taped the post-mortem above his dorm bunk: “I am not competing against others; I am competing against complacency.”

The next year brought the Winter Camp in Beijing—thirty students, central-heated dorms, snowflakes the size of renminbi coins. Lectures ran from 8 a.m. to midnight: segment trees after breakfast, network flow before lights-out. Professor Wu, a grizzled alumnus of IOI ’96, announced on day one, “You will dream in graphs or you will not dream at all.” Under Wu’s sharp eyes, Zemin implemented persistent treaps that spun across his monitor like dragon dances, balanced fractions of milliseconds off CRT-monitored benchmarks, and learned to treat segmentation fault (core dumped) as Zen koan rather than tragedy. Chen and Li sometimes collapsed into snoring piles on beanbags, but Zemin stayed up to watch professor-recorded replays of historic IOI tasks, pausing frames to map contestants’ cursor jitters to cognitive states.

In March the camp’s ranking exam doubled as the national team shortlist. The test comprised three problems: a deceptively easy combinatorics warm-up, a graph-matching behemoth, and a final puzzle about minimal lexicographic paths on a toroidal grid—all within five hours. When the bell rang, Zemin’s code still compiled. He pressed Enter with a steady hand and left the computer lab shaking only after the verdict: full marks. Wu sidled over and said, almost tenderly, “Take tonight off. Even machines cool down.” Outside, Beijing’s streetlamps haloed the falling snow like pixels.

April letters confirmed what rumor had foretold: Liu Zemin, Chen Xiaowen, Li Rui, and another prodigy from Guangzhou would represent China at IOI 2025 in Singapore. The Ministry of Education issued matching blazers; a tech giant sponsored mechanical keyboards with adjustable actuation; CCTV scheduled a documentary crew. Zemin returned to Anhui briefly before departure and found his grandmother murmuring over prayer beads. “The rooster still crows the same,” she told him. He smiled; chaos sometimes obeyed constants.

Singapore’s humidity slapped the team as they stepped from Changi Airport’s sliding glass doors. The venue—a convention center trimmed with LED banners—hummed with 350 of the world’s sharpest teenage programmers, each badge a meteor waiting to streak. Practice session zero exposed every latent weakness: Zemin’s laptop overheated, his Chinese-character input crashed JudgeClient, and an unspoken dread stirred. But that night in the hotel he recalled Ms. Zhang’s rain-washed boards and felt calm spread like ink in water. He rewrote his dotfiles, pre-compiled templates, and fell asleep to the gentle click of the air-conditioner.

Competition Day 1

Three tasks, five hours, 100 points each. The first—“Islands”—required detecting bridges in dynamic graphs. Easy, 20-line DFS. The second—“Flower”—hid a combinatorial explosion behind floral motifs; Zemin derived a generating-function trick and earned 86/100. The third—“Galaxy Jump”—combined longest-path queries with bitset magic; his algorithm oscillated between O(N²) and O(N √N), timeouts sporadic. He submitted two minutes before end, scoring a meager 12. When results flashed, he ranked eighth overall, second among his own team. Respectable but brittle: one slip on Day 2 could bury him.

That evening he walked Clarke Quay, neon rippling on the river. Tourists laughed over chili crab; canoe paddles slapped water like clock hands. Zemin counted the strokes—thirty-seven made a crossing—and decided numbers were allies, not judges. Back at the hotel, Professor Wu found him tinkering with Fenwick trees. “Sleep,” Wu ordered. “Tomorrow, gold is an attitude, not a color.”

Competition Day 2

Problems pivoted nastily. “Pandas” cloaked DP in probabilistic traps; “Mirrors” demanded computational geometry with precision errors lurking; and “Subway,” the rumored heartbreaker, mixed l-ca queries with offline updates. Zemin rehearsed mental mantras: Edge cases first, brute-force second, optimize third. He brute-forced “Pandas” in half an hour, grabbed 50 safe points, then hammered a memoized recurrence for full marks by 90-minute mark. “Mirrors” fell after he re-derived Snell’s law in integer space, earning 95. “Subway” remained. With an hour left, he noticed station indices formed bit-reversible patterns—latent FFT friendliness. He stitched a binary-lifting + Mo’s-algorithm hybrid no coach had ever taught. Compile: success. Run: 0.74 seconds of the 1-second limit—tight, but green. He exhaled centuries.

When the scoreboard froze for suspense, Zemin ranked first by three points over a Lithuanian wunderkind. Results would be final after system tests. Two agonizing hours later, inside a ballroom chilled to meat-locker levels, flags flickered onscreen. Bronze names scrolled, then silver. Chen Xiaowen’s turned silver to cheers. Gold band enlarged. Li Rui’s name flashed. The Lithuanian’s. And topmost: CHN — Liu Zemin — Gold, 593/600. Time dilated. For a heartbeat he heard only poultry calls echoing from childhood dawns.

Onstage a volunteer draped a medal of plated sunshine around his neck. Cameras exploded. He recalled the broken sandal, the cracked Lenovo, the dorm post-mortem. Each hardship crystallized into a single weighty disk that smelled faintly of freshly cut circuitry.

Homecoming

Hefei Station platform overflowed with banners: “Warm Congratulations to IOI Gold Medalist Liu Zemin!” Ms. Zhang wept into a bouquet; Professor Wu posed, unsmiling, beside a noodle shop. In Lujiang, villagers painted the school gate red. The rooster, indifferent, still crowed thirty-seven times the next dawn, and Zemin counted them once more, just to be sure the universe held steady.

Media interviews followed: Will you enter Tsinghua? MIT? Found a startup? He answered politely, though another question pulsed louder: What next numbers await tallying? One midnight, staring at his medal lying beside a sleeping laptop, he drafted a letter to future self: “Winning IOI is not a summit; it is a base camp. Mountains of unsolved problems loom higher—P versus NP, prime gaps, quantum error correction. Climb.”

He folded the letter, placed it beneath the pebbles preserved since childhood, and finally slept, dreaming not of medals but of rivers of numbers yet to chart their winding course.
