Ever since I was five years old, I’ve been obsessed with the idea of making things fair. Whether it was making sure my little brother got the same number of cookies as me, or standing up when a classmate got picked on, I always felt a fire in my chest when something wasn’t right. I didn't know the word for it back then, but now I know it’s called justice. And now that I’m thirteen, I have a name for the dream that justice leads me to: I want to be President of the United States.

People laugh when I say that. Or worse, they smile politely and say things like “That’s nice, sweetie” or “That’s very ambitious.” But I’m not looking for a pat on the head—I’m looking for a podium, a platform, a purpose. I want to change the world, not be congratulated for having the courage to say so.

I grew up in a small town in Ohio. Not exactly the kind of place where people expect big dreams to sprout. My mom is a school teacher, and my dad works at a factory. We’re not rich, but we have love and books, and that’s more valuable to me than anything else. My mom used to read me stories every night—about Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harriet Tubman, and even modern leaders like Michelle Obama. She told me, “You can be anything you want to be. Even President.”

But the world doesn’t always agree with Mom. I remember one time in second grade, we did a “When I Grow Up” project. I drew myself in a suit standing at a podium with the American flag behind me. My teacher smiled but said, “Maybe you should pick something more realistic—like a lawyer or a teacher.” I remember feeling confused. Why would being President be any less realistic than being a lawyer? Boys said they wanted to be astronauts, inventors, even superheroes, and nobody questioned them.

As I got older, I started learning more about how the country works. I joined the student council and started reading the news every morning with my cereal. I followed elections like other kids followed celebrity drama. I watched debates like some people watch football. I studied speeches, observed how leaders handled crises, and kept a notebook where I wrote what I would do if I were President. I called it my "POTUS Planbook."

At school, I began to see more clearly how unfairness plays out in real time. A classmate got suspended for standing up for himself against a bully. Girls weren’t taken as seriously in science class. Immigrant kids got teased for their accents. I spoke up. I wrote essays. I started a lunch club where people could talk about social justice. My friends started calling me “Madame President” as a joke. But secretly, I hoped they meant it seriously.

Representation matters. That’s something I learned from watching Kamala Harris become Vice President. I cried when she gave her speech—not because I was sad, but because I saw myself in her. A woman, a daughter of immigrants, someone who had probably heard a thousand times that she was aiming too high. And yet, there she stood, confident and calm, rewriting what was possible for girls like me.

It’s not just about being in power—it’s about using that power to make room for others. I want every little girl to grow up in a country where they never doubt that they belong at the table. Where they don’t feel like guests in the room of leadership, but hosts, architects, builders.

Of course, it’s not always easy. There are days I wonder if I’m being naïve. Politics is messy. Adults tell me it’s full of compromise, betrayal, and half-truths. They say, “You’ll understand when you’re older.” But maybe that’s the problem. Maybe when people grow up, they learn to lower their expectations instead of raising their voices.

I don’t want to grow up into someone who accepts things the way they are. I want to grow up into someone who questions things, who pushes things, who builds better things. That doesn’t mean I don’t listen. It means I listen carefully, and then I act bravely.

There’s also the fear. The fear of failure. The fear of being judged. The fear of not being smart enough, tough enough, perfect enough. But then I remember: even presidents feel fear. What matters is what you do with it.

I know becoming President won’t happen overnight. It will take years of studying, working, campaigning, losing, learning, and growing. I’ll have to run for offices no one cares about first—student government, city council, maybe school board. I’ll have to fight for causes, not just titles. I’ll have to listen more than I speak, and when I do speak, it has to be with thought and truth.

I want to go to law school. I want to study history, psychology, public policy. I want to understand people—not just how they vote, but why they vote the way they do. I want to find common ground. I want to speak for those who can’t find the words, or who’ve never been invited to speak at all.

One day, I will walk onto a debate stage, and someone will ask me: “What makes you think you deserve to be President?”

And I will answer:
“Because I never stopped believing in what this country could be. Because I saw the cracks and chose to build, not break. Because I loved this place enough to challenge it. Because I am a girl from Ohio, a daughter of teachers and dreamers, and I am ready to serve.”

And maybe, just maybe, some other little girl will be watching. Maybe she’ll be five years old, with messy braids and a fire in her chest, and she’ll look at the TV screen and whisper, “One day, that’ll be me.”

There are nights when I lie in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if any of this will really happen. I picture myself walking into a campaign office, surrounded by people in suits with clipboards. I imagine the headlines, the interviews, the debates. But then a little voice creeps in.

“Do you really think they’ll vote for you?”

It’s not always easy to silence that voice. That voice is built from centuries of doors being closed to people who looked like me, talked like me, or dared to believe too boldly. It’s built from history books that barely mention women unless they were queens, first ladies, or footnotes. It’s built from the way people assume leadership means power, not service.

But I’ve learned to talk back to that voice.

“Yes,” I whisper. “They’ll vote for me because I’ll give them something worth believing in.”

That conversation repeats itself more often than I care to admit. Sometimes I win. Sometimes doubt wins. But each time, I come back stronger, like muscles rebuilding after being stretched. Doubt isn’t my enemy—it’s my training partner.

In eighth grade, I organized my school’s first student-led town hall. I convinced our principal to give us the auditorium for a day. I made flyers. I recruited speakers. I prepared a speech about why our school needed better recycling, more inclusive lunch menus, and mental health check-ins for students.

Was it perfect? No. The mic broke halfway through. Some people whispered jokes in the back. I forgot one of my bullet points. But something amazing happened after it was over.

People clapped.

Teachers came up to me afterward and said they hadn’t realized how much students were paying attention. A sixth grader told me she wanted to start a club, just like I did. My social studies teacher gave me a high five and said, “You’ve got the heart of a leader.”

That night, I wrote in my journal:
“Leadership isn’t about waiting. It’s about doing, now—before anyone gives you a title.”

If I ever make it to the White House, I know exactly what kind of President I want to be. I don’t just want to sign laws. I want to listen to people. I want to hold town halls across the country—not just in big cities, but in small towns that feel forgotten. I want kids to be able to write to me and actually get a response. I want to surround myself with smart, diverse thinkers who challenge me and help me grow.

I don’t want to lead with fear—I want to lead with hope.

I want a country where no child goes hungry, where healthcare isn’t a luxury, where teachers are paid what they’re worth, and where nobody feels like they have to hide who they are to be safe.

I want to make climate change the top priority—not because it’s trendy, but because it’s the future of every child not yet born.

I want to make voting easier, not harder. I want every American to feel like their voice matters.

I want justice to mean more than punishment. I want it to mean fairness, equity, and healing.

Some people think politics is boring. To me, it’s deeply personal.

Politics decides whether my friend with diabetes can afford her insulin.

It decides whether the family down the street can stay in their apartment after the rent goes up.

It decides if the kid in my math class, whose parents are undocumented, gets to live without fear.

It decides who gets believed, who gets protected, and who gets forgotten.

How could that ever be boring?

To me, running for President isn’t about being famous or powerful. It’s about responsibility. It’s about stewardship. It’s about showing up, again and again, with open ears, a steady hand, and a heart that refuses to grow cold.

Of course, I know the road ahead won’t be easy.

I’ll have to go to college—maybe major in political science or international relations. I’ll probably have to work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously. I’ll make mistakes. I’ll get criticized. There will be days when everything feels impossible.

But I’ve seen what happens when people keep showing up. I’ve watched documentaries on John Lewis and read speeches by Shirley Chisholm. I’ve studied how AOC started with a campaign no one believed in. I’ve watched ordinary people change history because they refused to stay silent.

I want to be part of that lineage.

Not because I think I’m perfect, but because I believe I can grow. Because I know how to ask questions. Because I’m not afraid to say, “I don’t know—but I’ll find out.”

Sometimes I look in the mirror and try to imagine myself in the Oval Office.

Not in some fantasy way, but in a real, grounded way.

I imagine my curly hair tucked into a neat bun, my voice calm and measured, my hand reaching out to sign a law that will help someone I’ve never even met.

I imagine the weight of it—not just the job, but the history. The pressure of knowing that everything I say and do could shape the lives of millions. And I don’t shrink from that image. I rise to it.

People say, “What makes you think a girl like you could be President?”

And I say, “It’s precisely because I’m a girl like me that I must try.”

I believe dreams are like candles. Once you light one, it can light others without losing its own flame. My dream of being President isn’t just about me—it’s about the girls watching, the boys listening, the grown-ups remembering what it felt like to believe in something bigger than themselves.

It’s about turning the word "impossible" into “I’m possible.”

One day, someone will introduce me:
“Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.”

And I’ll step onto that stage—not because I was the loudest, or the richest, or the most polished—but because I never stopped believing in the power of words, the strength of community, and the necessity of hope.

Until then, I’ll keep studying. I’ll keep speaking up. I’ll keep leading where I am. Because the journey doesn’t start when I win an election.

The journey has already begun.
